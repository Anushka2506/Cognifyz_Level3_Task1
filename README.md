Level 3 Task 1: Image Manipulation Gallery
📌 Project Overview
This project is part of my Web Development internship at @Cognifyz Technologies. The objective was to demonstrate advanced image manipulation techniques using only HTML5 and CSS3. The project features an automatic image slider and a fully functional interactive gallery with a lightbox effect.

🚀 Key Features
1. Automatic Image Slideshow
Pure CSS Transitions: Implemented using @keyframes and the transform property to slide images horizontally.

Seamless Looping: The slider is designed to transition between three high-definition images automatically every few seconds.

Flexbox Layout: Ensures the images are aligned perfectly within the slider container without gaps.

2. Interactive Image Gallery
Click-to-Enlarge (Lightbox): Uses the CSS :target pseudo-class to open a full-screen view of images when a thumbnail is clicked—eliminating the need for JavaScript.

Glassmorphism UI: The enlarged view features a modern backdrop-filter: blur() effect, creating a premium frosted-glass aesthetic.

Animated Interactions: Thumbnails include a "pop-out" hover effect using cubic-bezier transitions for a smooth, tactile feel.

3. Professional UI/UX
Custom Color Palette: Uses a sophisticated "Muted Slate" linear gradient background to reduce eye strain and make the imagery pop.

Responsive Design: The gallery grid uses flex-wrap to ensure compatibility across different screen sizes.

Styled Components: A custom-designed circular close button with a 90-degree rotation hover effect.

🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML5: For semantic structure.

CSS3: Including:

Advanced Animations (@keyframes)

Pseudo-classes (:target, :hover)

Flexbox Layouts

Linear Gradients & Glassmorphism (backdrop-filter)
